# Classy MT4 Preview

Are you stuck on MT4 at the CBC? Is your **Preview** button useless? Here's a fix:

1. Install the [TamperMonkey extension for Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo).

2. Once TaperMonkey is installed, click [this userscript link](https://github.com/misener/Classy-MT4-Preview/raw/master/classyMT4preview.user.js) and click **Install** when prompted.

Now, when you click the **Preview** button in CBC's MT4 installation, you'll actually see a preview.

**Note:** you'll have to click the "back" button twice to return to MT4 for editing.
